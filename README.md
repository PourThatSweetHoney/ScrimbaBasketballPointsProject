# ScrimbaBasketballPointsProject

In the Scrimba tutorial I am doing online, I was supposed to make a basketball score counter.  
However, there was no direction, only what it should look like and what it should do in the end.  

While at bare minimum I had to implement a program that incremented two clocks, the tutorial suggested I add a few things if I felt like it.  

So, I decided to implement two reset buttons and decided to teach myself how to add sound effects to a web page (something i've never done before)

First, I designed the project to make it look like it was supposed to by messing with the CSS
I needed to get the proper font for the counter so I went online and looked up a digital clock font to use for the project 
(this was the first time I ever imported a font into a CSS file)
Then I added a few pictures and got the alignment correct.  

Once everything was put together, i started working on the javascript.  The only difficulty was getting the sound effects to work, 
but after renaming the files I was able to get it to work.  Also, I realized halfway in that I was reusing the same code in every function,
so I created a seperate function to run the sound effects.  

In the end, I feel pretty proud of what I created.
